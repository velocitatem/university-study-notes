#+title: University Notes

All the notes which I take to prepare for exams can be found in the =/content= folder. They then get linked to my website, and published here [[alves.world/university]]. Like this, anyone can suggest an edit or addition to the notes and it then gets automatically integrated.

The notes are written in org-mode, which is a very simple and intuitive markdown language.

+ Dont have gitlab? :: You can send an email [[mailto:contact-project+velocitatem-university-study-notes-41352476-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com][here]] saying whats wrong.
