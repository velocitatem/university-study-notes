* Electromagnetism: Static Fields
There are 4 fundamental forces in nature: Gravity, Electromagnetism, Weak Nuclear Force and Strong Nuclear Force. Electromagnetic forces rely on particles which have a charge.
** Electrostatic Fields
*** Electric Charge
Charge, is something as fundamental as mass. It is what determines how intense electromagnetic forces are. Here are some fundamental laws which govern charge:
- Charge is conserved. If you have a positive charge, you can't have a negative charge. If you have a negative charge, you can't have a positive charge.
- Charge is quantized. Charge is measured in units of elementary charge, which is $e = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} C$. This means that you can't have a charge of $1.5e$.
- Charge is additive. If you have two charges, you can add them together to get the total charge. For example, if you have a charge of $+1e$ and a charge of $-1e$, you can add them together to get a total charge of $0e$.
- Opposite charges attract, and like charges will repel.


*** Ions
An Ion is just a charged particle. It is a particle which has a charge. For example, a proton is an ion with a charge of $+1e$. A neutron is an ion with a charge of $0e$. An electron is an ion with a charge of $-1e$.
+ What determines if an Ion is positive or negative? :: It is determined by the number of protons and electrons. If the number of protons is greater than the number of electrons, then the Ion is positive. If the number of electrons is greater than the number of protons, then the Ion is negative. If the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, then the Ion is neutral.
*** Conductivity of Matter
There are three main types:
+ Insulators :: This type of matter does not conduct electricity. For example, glass is an insulator.
+ Semiconductors :: This type of matter is a bit of an in-between. It can conduct electricity, but not very well. For example, silicon is a semiconductor.
+ Conductors :: This type of matter conducts electricity very well. For example, copper is a conductor.
*** Charging
We can charge on object in three ways: Friction, Induction and Conduction.
+ Friction :: This is when you rub two objects together. For example, if you rub a balloon on your hair, you will get a static charge on the balloon. Here the electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon through friction.
+ Induction :: This is when you bring a charged object near another object.
+ Conduction :: Electrons get transferred from one object to another, through direct contact.

*** Electric Polarization
If you have a neutrally charged object and you subject it to an electric field, it will become polarized. Meaning that the electrons will move to one side of the object, and the protons will move to the other side of the object.
+ Why does this happen? :: Because bodies charges have a tendency to align themselves with the electric field.

*** Electric Force
This is a force which is exerted between two charged objects. It is given by the equation, also knows as Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
\]


Where $k$ is the Coulomb constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between the two objects. The simplest definition of $k$ is:

\[
k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\]

Where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The permittivity of vacuum is a constant which is equal to $8.8541878128 \times 10^{-12} F/m$.

We can generally approximate $k$ as:

\[
k = 9 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2
\]


The electric force abides by the third law of Newtonian mechanics. This means that if object $A$ exerts a force on object $B$, then object $B$ will exert a force on object $A$ which is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction.

*** Superposition of Forces
Give two charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$ and a third charge $q_3$, the net force on $q_3$ is given by the vector sum of the forces exerted by $q_1$ and $q_2$.

Vector sum: [[Vector Sum]]

*** Electric Field
How do charges exert forces on other charges? They do so through the electric field. The electric field is a vector field which is defined as:

\[
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}
\]

Where $F$ is the force exerted on the charge, and $q$ is the charge. The electric field is a vector field, which means that it has a direction and a magnitude. The direction of the electric field is the direction of the force. The magnitude of the electric field is the magnitude of the force divided by the charge.


Useful video on electric field: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY]]

We can re-arrange this equation to get the force exerted on a specific point:

\[
\vec{F} = q \vec{E}
\]

For this to be possible, we need to know the electric field at that point. We can find the electric field at a point by many means. This is also only valid for point charges.

Some other key properties of the electric field:
+ The electric field is a vector field. This means that it has a direction and a magnitude.
+ Inside a conductor, the electric field is zero.


*** Electric Field of a Point Charge
The electric field of a point charge is given by:

\[
\vec{E} = \frac{k q}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

Where $k$ is the Coulomb constant, $q$ is the charge of the point charge, and $r$ is the distance between the point charge and the test charge. The electric field is a vector field, which means that it has a direction and a magnitude.

*** Electric Field Lines

[[file:./Electromagnetism:_Static_Fields/2023-01-29_17-07-48_.png]]

One of the most important properties of the electric field is that it is *symmetrical*. The spacing of the lines is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field. The closer the lines are together, the stronger the electric field. The further apart the lines are, the weaker the electric field. The direction of the lines is the direction of the electric field.
+ The electric field lines are a visual representation of the electric field. They are not a physical object.

*** Uniform Electric Filed

#+DOWNLOADED: https://phys.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/2861/Figure_20_02_01a.jpg?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=195&height=369 @ 2023-01-29 17:14:41
[[file:./Electromagnetism:_Static_Fields/2023-01-29_17-14-41_Figure_20_02_01a.jpg.jpeg]]


A uniform electric field is an electric field which is constant in all directions. The electric field lines are parallel to each other, and are equidistant from each other. The electric field lines are also perpendicular to the surface of the object.

Although not electric, gravity can be thought of as a uniform field, at least near the surface of the earth. It only goes down.
*** Electric Flux
The electric flux is the amount of electric field passing through a surface. It is given by the equation:

\[
\Phi = \int_S \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}
\]

The flux will primarily depend on two factors: the angle relative to the surface and which side of the surface we are measuring.

*** Gauss's Law
It equates flux, to the charge enclosed by the surface. It is given by the equation:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
\]

Where $\Phi$ is the electric flux, $Q$ is the charge enclosed by the surface, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The permittivity of vacuum is a constant which is equal to $8.8541878128 \times 10^{-12} F/m$.

It is valid for anything. When we talk about an enclosed surface, it does not have to be a physical surface.

1. $\Phi = \frac{2.0 \mu C}{\epsilon_0} = 2.3 \times 10^5 N \cdot m^2/C$
2. $\Phi = -\frac{2.0 \mu C}{\epsilon_0} = -2.3 \times 10^5 N \cdot m^2/C$

5. $\Phi = \frac{4.0 \mu C + 6.0 \mu C - 10.0 \mu C}{\epsilon_0} = 0$

**** Gauss's Law for Conductors
In a conductor, the electric field is zero. Any excess charge will only be at the surface. This means that
*** Electric Potential
First we have to understand the concept of potential energy. Potential energy is the energy that an object has due to its position (or configuration). It is given by the equation:

\[
U = mgh
\]

This is gravitational potential energy.

Electric potential energy is the amount of work that needs to be done when moving a unit charge against an electric field. It is given by the equation:

\[
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1}{\vec{r} - \vec{r}^\prime}
\]

Where $V(\vec{r})$ is the electric potential energy, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $q_1$ is the charge, $\vec{r}$ is the position of the charge, and $\vec{r}^\prime$ is the position of the point where we are measuring the electric potential energy.


The entire system is also governed by:

# latex gradient symbol: \nabla
\[
\vec{E} = -\nabla V (\vec{r})
\]

Where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field, $\vec{r}$ is the position vector, and $V$ is the electric potential.

The scalar function for the electric potential is called the electric potential function. It is given by the equation:

\[
U = q_1 \cdot V(\vec{r})
\]

Where $U$ is the electric potential energy, $q_0$ is the charge, and $V$ is the electric potential.

Some key points about the electric potential:
+ If a force does positive work, then the potential energy decreases
+ The slightest difference in potential energy. *We must have some sort of reference point* where $U = 0$, this is called the *ground*.



*** Voltage
Voltage is the difference in electric potential energy between two points. It is given by the equation:

\[
V = V_2 - V_1
\]

Where $V$ is the voltage, $V_1$ is the electric potential energy at point 1, and $V_2$ is the electric potential energy at point 2.

*** Electric Work
Here we are talking about a force acting on a moving particle. The work done by the force is given by the equation:

\[
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}
\]

Where $W$ is the work done, $\vec{F}$ is the force, and $\vec{r}$ is the position vector. This is what is called a [[Line Integral]].

If we are in an uniform electric field, the work done by the electric field is given by the equation:

\[
W_{a\to b} = Fd = q_0 Ed
\]

Where $W_{a\to b}$ is the work done by the electric field, $F$ is the force, $q_0$ is the charge, $E$ is the electric field, and $d$ is the distance.

*** Electric Dipole
An electric dipole is a system of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance $d$. The electric dipole moment is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{p} = q_0 \vec{d}
\]

Where $\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment, $q_0$ is the charge, and $\vec{d}$ is the distance between the two charges. What is a moment? It is a measure of how much an electric field will rotate a dipole. The electric dipole moment is a vector quantity.

If we take a dipole, and pop it into an electric field, it will rotate to *align itself*. The torque is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
\]

Where $\vec{\tau}$ is the torque, $\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment, and $\vec{E}$ is the electric field. This is just an extra.

What is important, is the potential energy of a dipole. The potential energy of a dipole is given by the equation:

\[
U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
\]

Where $U$ is the potential energy, $\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment, and $\vec{E}$ is the electric field.

*** Dielectrics
This is an insulator, that gets polarized when an electric field is applied. The polarization is the separation of charge.

We talked a lot about permittivity and dielectric constant. The permittivity of a dielectric is given by the equation:

\[
\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r
\]

Where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity.

You can find a table of relative permittivity here: [[Relative Permittivity Table]].

*** Capacitors
A capacitor is like a battery, but it stores energy in the form of electric charge. It consists of two conductors separated by an insulator.


#+DOWNLOADED: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-Mynz5eHeW48%2FVf8JRZ8RiwI%2FAAAAAAAAADk%2FPqdQw_OHWmU%2Fs640%2FCapacitor.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=462af8ab894a02db349f7b0a9f0f90b1d15456353db2cedc3ed33a3a7616bf85&ipo=images @ 2023-02-01 16:00:42
[[file:Electromagnetism:_Static_Fields/2023-02-01_16-00-42_.png]]

How do we charge a capacitor? We can charge it by connecting it to a battery. The battery will supply a constant current to the capacitor. The capacitor will charge up until the voltage across the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the battery. The current will then stop flowing.

The capacitance of a capacitor is given by the equation:

\[
C = \frac{Q}{V}
\]

Where $C$ is the capacitance, $Q$ is the charge, and $V$ is the voltage. This is given in the units of Farads.

Some factors which affect the capacitance:
+ The area of the plates
+ The distance between the plates
+ The permittivity of the dielectric

The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by the equation:

\[
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

Where $C$ is the capacitance, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d$ is the distance between the plates.

** Vector Sum
A vector sum is just the addition of two vectors. For example, if you have two vectors, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, then the vector sum of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x + b_x \\ a_y + b_y \end{bmatrix}
\]
** Line Integral
A definite integral gives use the area under the curve. This is done by taking very small slices of the curve and adding them together. A line integral is the same thing, but instead of taking slices of the curve, we take slices of the line and then multiply the slides by the vector filed.
