There are 4 fundamental forces in nature: Gravity, Electromagnetism, Weak Nuclear Force and Strong Nuclear Force. Electromagnetic forces rely on particles which have a charge.
* Electrostatic Fields
** Electric Charge
Charge, is something as fundamental as mass. It is what determines how intense electromagnetic forces are. Here are some fundamental laws which govern charge:
- Charge is conserved. If you have a positive charge, you can't have a negative charge. If you have a negative charge, you can't have a positive charge.
- Charge is quantized. Charge is measured in units of elementary charge, which is $e = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} C$. This means that you can't have a charge of $1.5e$.
- Charge is additive. If you have two charges, you can add them together to get the total charge. For example, if you have a charge of $+1e$ and a charge of $-1e$, you can add them together to get a total charge of $0e$.
- Opposite charges attract, and like charges will repel.

** Ions
An Ion is just a charged particle. It is a particle which has a charge. For example, a proton is an ion with a charge of $+1e$. A neutron is an ion with a charge of $0e$. An electron is an ion with a charge of $-1e$.
+ What determines if an Ion is positive or negative? :: It is determined by the number of protons and electrons. If the number of protons is greater than the number of electrons, then the Ion is positive. If the number of electrons is greater than the number of protons, then the Ion is negative. If the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, then the Ion is neutral.
** Conductivity of Matter
There are three main types:
+ Insulators :: This type of matter does not conduct electricity. For example, glass is an insulator.
+ Semiconductors :: This type of matter is a bit of an in-between. It can conduct electricity, but not very well. For example, silicon is a semiconductor.
+ Conductors :: This type of matter conducts electricity very well. For example, copper is a conductor.
** Charging
We can charge on object in three ways: Friction, Induction and Conduction.
+ Friction :: This is when you rub two objects together. For example, if you rub a balloon on your hair, you will get a static charge on the balloon. Here the electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon through friction.
+ Induction :: This is when you bring a charged object near another object.
+ Conduction :: Electrons get transferred from one object to another, through direct contact.

** Electric Polarization
If you have a neutrally charged object and you subject it to an electric field, it will become polarized. Meaning that the electrons will move to one side of the object, and the protons will move to the other side of the object.
+ Why does this happen? :: Because bodies charges have a tendency to align themselves with the electric field.

** Electric Force
This is a force which is exerted between two charged objects. It is given by the equation, also knows as Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
\]


Where $k$ is the Coulomb constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between the two objects. The simplest definition of $k$ is:

\[
k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\]

Where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The permittivity of vacuum is a constant which is equal to $8.8541878128 \times 10^{-12} F/m$.

We can generally approximate $k$ as:

\[
k = 9 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2
\]


The electric force abides by the third law of Newtonian mechanics. This means that if object $A$ exerts a force on object $B$, then object $B$ will exert a force on object $A$ which is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction.

** Superposition of Forces
Give two charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$ and a third charge $q_3$, the net force on $q_3$ is given by the vector sum of the forces exerted by $q_1$ and $q_2$.

Vector sum: [[Vector Sum]]

** Electric Field
How do charges exert forces on other charges? They do so through the electric field. The electric field is a vector field which is defined as:

\[
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}
\]

Where $F$ is the force exerted on the charge, and $q$ is the charge. The electric field is a vector field, which means that it has a direction and a magnitude. The direction of the electric field is the direction of the force. The magnitude of the electric field is the magnitude of the force divided by the charge.


Useful video on electric field: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY]]

We can re-arrange this equation to get the force exerted on a specific point:

\[
\vec{F} = q \vec{E}
\]

For this to be possible, we need to know the electric field at that point. We can find the electric field at a point by many means. This is also only valid for point charges.

Some other key properties of the electric field:
+ The electric field is a vector field. This means that it has a direction and a magnitude.
+ Inside a conductor, the electric field is zero.

** Electric Field of a Point Charge
The electric field of a point charge is given by:

\[
\vec{E} = \frac{k q}{r^2} \hat{r}
\]

Where $k$ is the Coulomb constant, $q$ is the charge of the point charge, and $r$ is the distance between the point charge and the test charge. The electric field is a vector field, which means that it has a direction and a magnitude.

** Electric Field Lines

[[file:./Electromagnetism:_Static_Fields/2023-01-29_17-07-48_.png]]

One of the most important properties of the electric field is that it is *symmetrical*. The spacing of the lines is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field. The closer the lines are together, the stronger the electric field. The further apart the lines are, the weaker the electric field. The direction of the lines is the direction of the electric field.
+ The electric field lines are a visual representation of the electric field. They are not a physical object.

** Uniform Electric Filed

#+DOWNLOADED: https://phys.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/2861/Figure_20_02_01a.jpg?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=195&height=369 @ 2023-01-29 17:14:41
[[file:./Electromagnetism:_Static_Fields/2023-01-29_17-14-41_Figure_20_02_01a.jpg.jpeg]]


A uniform electric field is an electric field which is constant in all directions. The electric field lines are parallel to each other, and are equidistant from each other. The electric field lines are also perpendicular to the surface of the object.

Although not electric, gravity can be thought of as a uniform field, at least near the surface of the earth. It only goes down.
** Electric Flux
The electric flux is the amount of electric field passing through a surface. It is given by the equation:

\[
\Phi = \int_S \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}
\]

The flux will primarily depend on two factors: the angle relative to the surface and which side of the surface we are measuring.

** Gauss's Law
It equates flux, to the charge enclosed by the surface. It is given by the equation:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
\]

Where $\Phi$ is the electric flux, $Q$ is the charge enclosed by the surface, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The permittivity of vacuum is a constant which is equal to $8.8541878128 \times 10^{-12} F/m$.

It is valid for anything. When we talk about an enclosed surface, it does not have to be a physical surface.

5. $\Phi = \frac{4.0 \mu C + 6.0 \mu C - 10.0 \mu C}{\epsilon_0} = 0$

*** Gauss's Law for Conductors
In a conductor, the electric field is zero. Any excess charge will only be at the surface. This means that
** Electric Potential
First we have to understand the concept of potential energy. Potential energy is the energy that an object has due to its position (or configuration). It is given by the equation:

\[
U = mgh
\]

This is gravitational potential energy.

Electric potential energy is the amount of work that needs to be done when moving a unit charge against an electric field. It is given by the equation:

\[
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1}{\vec{r} - \vec{r}^\prime}
\]

Where $V(\vec{r})$ is the electric potential energy, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $q_1$ is the charge, $\vec{r}$ is the position of the charge, and $\vec{r}^\prime$ is the position of the point where we are measuring the electric potential energy.


The entire system is also governed by:

# latex gradient symbol: \nabla
\[
\vec{E} = -\nabla V (\vec{r})
\]

Where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field, $\vec{r}$ is the position vector, and $V$ is the electric potential.

The scalar function for the electric potential is called the electric potential function. It is given by the equation:

\[
U = q_1 \cdot V(\vec{r})
\]

Where $U$ is the electric potential energy, $q_0$ is the charge, and $V$ is the electric potential.

Some key points about the electric potential:
+ If a force does positive work, then the potential energy decreases
+ The slightest difference in potential energy. *We must have some sort of reference point* where $U = 0$, this is called the *ground*.

** Voltage
Voltage is the difference in electric potential energy between two points. It is given by the equation:

\[
V = V_2 - V_1
\]

Where $V$ is the voltage, $V_1$ is the electric potential energy at point 1, and $V_2$ is the electric potential energy at point 2.

** Electric Work
Here we are talking about a force acting on a moving particle. The work done by the force is given by the equation:

\[
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}
\]

Where $W$ is the work done, $\vec{F}$ is the force, and $\vec{r}$ is the position vector. This is what is called a [[Line Integral]].

If we are in an uniform electric field, the work done by the electric field is given by the equation:

\[
W_{a\to b} = Fd = q_0 Ed
\]

Where $W_{a\to b}$ is the work done by the electric field, $F$ is the force, $q_0$ is the charge, $E$ is the electric field, and $d$ is the distance.

** Electric Dipole
An electric dipole is a system of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance $d$. The electric dipole moment is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{p} = q_0 \vec{d}
\]

Where $\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment, $q_0$ is the charge, and $\vec{d}$ is the distance between the two charges. What is a moment? It is a measure of how much an electric field will rotate a dipole. The electric dipole moment is a vector quantity.

If we take a dipole, and pop it into an electric field, it will rotate to *align itself*. The torque is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}
\]

Where $\vec{\tau}$ is the torque, $\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment, and $\vec{E}$ is the electric field. This is just an extra.

What is important, is the potential energy of a dipole. The potential energy of a dipole is given by the equation:

\[
U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
\]

Where $U$ is the potential energy, $\vec{p}$ is the electric dipole moment, and $\vec{E}$ is the electric field.

** Dielectrics
This is an insulator, that gets polarized when an electric field is applied. The polarization is the separation of charge.

We talked a lot about permittivity and dielectric constant. The permittivity of a dielectric is given by the equation:

\[
\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r
\]

Where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity.

You can find a table of relative permittivity here: [[Relative Permittivity Table]].

** Capacitors
A capacitor is like a battery, but it stores energy in the form of electric charge. It consists of two conductors separated by an insulator.


#+DOWNLOADED: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-Mynz5eHeW48%2FVf8JRZ8RiwI%2FAAAAAAAAADk%2FPqdQw_OHWmU%2Fs640%2FCapacitor.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=462af8ab894a02db349f7b0a9f0f90b1d15456353db2cedc3ed33a3a7616bf85&ipo=images @ 2023-02-01 16:00:42
[[file:./Electromagnetism:_Static_Fields/2023-02-01_16-00-42_.png]]

How do we charge a capacitor? We can charge it by connecting it to a battery. The battery will supply a constant current to the capacitor. The capacitor will charge up until the voltage across the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the battery. The current will then stop flowing.

The capacitance of a capacitor is given by the equation:

\[
C = \frac{Q}{V}
\]

Where $C$ is the capacitance, $Q$ is the charge, and $V$ is the voltage. This is given in the units of Farads.

Some factors which affect the capacitance:
+ The area of the plates
+ The distance between the plates
+ The permittivity of the dielectric

The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by the equation:

\[
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

Where $C$ is the capacitance, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d$ is the distance between the plates.

* Magneto-static Fields
** Electric Current
This is pretty much the same type of current as we can observe in water. It is the flow of charge through space. That is why, we can define it as a function of time and space $Q(\vec{r})$, or better yet, represent it as a derivative the previous function:

\[
I = \frac{dQ}{dt}
\]

Where $\vec{I}$ is the current, $Q$ is the charge, and $t$ is time. Alternatively, we can define it as:

\[
I = nqv_d A
\]

Where $I$ is the current, $n$ is the number of particles per unit volume, $q$ is the charge of a single particle, $v_d$ is the drift velocity, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area which we are focusing on.
Current is not a vector, but it is a scalar quantity. It is a measure in amperes (A).

*** Vector Current Density
What is this? It is the current per unit volume. It is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{J} = nq\vec{v_d}
\]

Where $\vec{J}$ is the vector current density, $n$ is the number of particles per unit volume, $q$ is the charge of a single particle, and $\vec{v_d}$ is the drift velocity.
The magnitude is given by the equation:

\[
\vert \vec{J} \vert = I / A
\]

Where $\vert \vec{J} \vert$ is the vector current density, $I$ is the current, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area.


*The key difference here is that the current is a scalar quantity, and the vector current density is a vector quantity.*
** Drift Velocity
We have already mentioned this a few times. To better understand what this is, imagine a lot of bouncy-balls thrown into a tube. If we look at a certain part of the tube, we can see that the bouncy-balls are moving in all directions, but if we zoom out and look at the tube as a whole, we can see that the bouncy-balls are moving in one direction. This is the drift velocity.

Now replace the tube with a wire, and the bouncy-balls with charges. The drift velocity is the average velocity of the charges in a wire. There will be a certain electric field which goes through the wire, the negative charges will feel a force opposite to the direction of the electric field, and they will move in the direction opposite of the electric field.
+ Negative charges move against the electric field
+ Positive charges move with the electric field
** Ohm's Law
Here we focus on the law in vector form. This means that we are going to focus on the vector current density, and not the current. The law is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}
\]

Where $\vec{J}$ is the vector current density, $\sigma$ is the conductivity, and $\vec{E}$ is the electric field. We can also replace $\sigma$ with $\rho$ but have to adjust a bit, since $\rho$ is the resistivity. The equation then becomes:

\[
\vec{J} = \frac{1}{\rho} \vec{E}
\]

** Resistance
#+HTML: <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:73%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6ozwFj8FgXGAo" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/favorite-aliens-dragonslayers-6ozwFj8FgXGAo">via GIPHY</a></p>

Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current. It is given by the equation:

\[
R = \rho L / A
\]

Where $R$ is the resistance, $\rho$ is the resistivity, $L$ is the length of the wire, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire. The units of resistance are ohms ($\Omega$).

** Resistivity
Resistivity is the resistance per unit length. It is given by the equation:

\[
\rho = \frac{R}{L}
\]

Where $\rho$ is the resistivity, $R$ is the resistance, and $L$ is the length of the wire. The units of resistivity are ohm-meters ($\Omega m$).

Important not to confuse the two.
** Electromotive Force
Another day another force. This is the force which causes the current to flow. It is given by the equation:

\[
\Epsilon = V_{ab}
\]

Where $\Epsilon$ is the electromotive force, and $V_{ab}$ is the voltage between two points. The units of electromotive force are volts ($V$).
** Magnetic Force
Now things might get a bit tricky. This is a force which occurs due to the motion of charges. It is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{F} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}}{r^2}
\]

Where $\vec{F}$ is the magnetic force, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $q$ is the charge, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $r$ is the distance between the charge and the magnetic field. The units of magnetic force are newtons ($N$).

Thats a hell of a lot of variables. Lets break it down a bit.
+ $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space
+ $q$ is the charge
+ $\vec{v}$ is the velocity
+ $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field
+ $r$ is the distance between the charge and the magnetic field

The key conceptual thing here is the cross product of two vectors. This is a vector perpendicular to both vectors. This is the direction of the magnetic force. How can we better understand this? We use the right hand rule. If we have two vectors, we can put our right hand in the direction of the first vector, we then curl our fingers in the direction of the second vector, and our thumb will point in the direction of the cross product. This is the direction of the magnetic force.

** Magnetic Field
When a charge moves, it creates a magnetic field. This is given by the equation:

\[
\vec{F} = q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}
\]

Where $\vec{F}$ is the magnetic force, $q$ is the charge, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. The units of magnetic field are tesla ($T$).

Some key concepts related to the magnetic field:
+ The magnetic field is a vector quantity
+ It is always perpendicular to the velocity of the charge

** Magnetic Field Lines

#+DOWNLOADED: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpixfeeds.com%2Fimages%2F41%2F611533%2F1280-magnetic-field-lines.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=f2aa09c68e45cb22d44902226c1896386dbab105b18c6549f2481bf111f0204e&ipo=images @ 2023-02-02 18:13:53
[[file:./Magneto-static_Fields/2023-02-02_18-13-53_.png]]

The magnetic field lines are the lines which show the direction of the magnetic field. They are perpendicular to the velocity of the charge. The magnetic field lines are closed loops.

They share some traits with the electric field lines:
+ They spacing is proportional to the magnitude of the field
+ They never intersect

** Magnetic Flux
Similar to the electric flux, this is the amount of magnetic field passing through a surface. It is given by the equation:

\[
\Phi = \int_S \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}
\]

Where $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $d\vec{A}$ is the differential area. The units of magnetic flux are webers ($Wb$).

** Gauss's Law of Magnetism
When you take a magnet, split it in half, each half will still have two poles. This is because the magnetic field is continuous. This is the law of magnetism. It is given by the equation:

\[
\oint_C \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = 0
\]

Where $\oint_C$ is the integral around a closed loop, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $d\vec{l}$ is the differential length. The units of Gauss's Law of Magnetism are tesla-meters ($Tm$).
** Ampere's Circuital Law

** Magnetic Dipole

** Hall Effect

* Electromagnetism: Dynamic Fields
** Motional Electromotive Force
If we have a conductive object moving through a magnetic field, it will create an electromotive force. This is given by the equation:

\[
\epsilon = \cint \vec{v} \times \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l}
\]

Where $\epsilon$ is the motional electromotive force, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $d\vec{l}$ is the length of the conductive object. The units of motional electromotive force are volts ($V$).

** Faraday's Law of Induction
In this law, we learn that a change in the magnetic flux, will create an electromotive force. You can also think of the change of flux as the second derivative of the magnetic field. This is given by the equation:

\[
\epsilon = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
\]

Where $\epsilon$ is the motional electromotive force, $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux, and $t$ is time. The units of Faraday's Law of Induction are volts per second ($V/s$).

+ If the flux is changing, only then will there be an electromotive force
+ A change in flux, does not only depend on the magnetic field, but also the area of the surface.


The direction of an electromotive force is given by the right hand rule. Since the law of induction has a minus sign in front of it, the direction of the electromotive force is opposite to the direction which will be indicated by the right hand rule, *unless the flux is changing*.
** Lenz's Law
The induced emf or current in a circuit opposes the change in magnetic flux. This law describes the natural tendency of a circuit to resist any change in the magnetic flux.


#+DOWNLOADED: https://atomstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demonstration-of-Lenzs-Law-1024x688.png @ 2023-02-20 18:40:52
[[file:./Electromagnetism:_Dynamic_Fields/2023-02-20_18-40-52_Demonstration-of-Lenzs-Law-1024x688.png]]

** Alternators
An alternator is device which converts mechanical rotational energy into electrical energy. It is a type of generator which makes use of the Faraday's Law of Induction. It is given by the equation:

\[
\epsilon = -N\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = -\frac{d}{dt} (BA \cos{\omega t}) = \omega B A \sin{\omega t}
\]

Where $\epsilon$ is the motional electromotive force, $N$ is the number of turns, $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux, $t$ is time, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $B$ is the magnetic field, and $A$ is the area. The units of alternators are volts ($V$).


** Self-Inductance
First, we need to redefine the emf as the change in current, because if we have a circuit, which is in a steady state, the emf will be zero, unless there is a change in current. This is given by the equation:

\[
\epsilon = -L\frac{dI}{dt}
\]

Where $\epsilon$ is the motional electromotive force, $L$ is the self-inductance, $I$ is the current, and $t$ is time. The units of self-inductance are henrys ($H$).

** Inductors
We can see self-inductance in circuits with these components:

#+DOWNLOADED: https://5.imimg.com/data5/SELLER/Default/2021/2/LI/SS/WC/26841306/whatsapp-image-2021-02-10-at-12-58-37-pm-1-.jpg @ 2023-02-20 18:48:42
[[file:Electromagnetism:_Dynamic_Fields/2023-02-20_18-48-42_whatsapp-image-2021-02-10-at-12-58-37-pm-1-.jpg]]

To calculate the self-inductance, we need to know the number of turns, the area of the coil, and the magnetic field. This is given by the equation:

\[
L = \frac{\muN^2 A}{2 \pi R}
\]

In a circuit we represent the component with a coil-like symbol. Why would we want to use such a component? Well, we can use it to store energy. This is because the emf is proportional to the change in current, and the change in current is proportional to the change in voltage. This means that if we have a circuit with a battery, and an inductor, the current will increase, and the voltage will decrease. This is because the battery is trying to increase the current, but the inductor is trying to decrease the current. This is called an inductive reactance.

** Mutual Inductance
If we have two coils, and we change the current in one coil, the other coil will also change its current. This is because the magnetic field is changing, and the magnetic field is changing because the current is changing.

For these kinds of problems, it is important to remember that any change in the magnetic field will create an electromotive force.
** Eddy Currents
Eddy currents, are currents which are created by a changing magnetic field. Although this might not be good for fine technology, as it can interfere, here are some applications of eddy currents:
+ Metal Detectors - detect eddy currents in metal
+ Heating - eddy currents create heat
+ Magnetic Breaking

*** Displacement Current
If the electric field changes, so will the magnetic field. This is because the magnetic field is proportional to the electric field.

We take amperes circuital law, and include the magnetic field:

\[
\oint_C \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 (i_c + i_D)_\text{enc}
\]

where:


\[
i_D = \epsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}
\]

Where $\Phi_E$ is the electric flux, and $t$ is time. The units of displacement current are amperes ($A$).



*** Maxwell's Equations
Finally, the good stuff. Maxwell's equations are the equations which describe the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields. They are given by the equations:

\begin{align}
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} &= \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} \\
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} &= 0 \\
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} &= \mu_0 (i_c + i_D)_\text{enc} \\
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} &= - \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
\end{align}

This is a compilation of:
1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields
3. Extended Ampere's Law
4. Faraday's Law of Induction

They will often be expressed in differential form:

\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \vec{B} &= \mu_0 (\vec{J} + \vec{D})_\text{enc}
\end{align}

*** Electromagnetic Waves
The key relationship here, is modeled by these equations:

\begin{align}
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} &= \epsilon_0 \mu_0 \frac{d}{dt}\int\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} \\
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} &= -\frac{d}{dt}\int\vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}
\end{align}

One of the most important properties, is $\vec{k}$. This is the wave vector, and it is given by:

\[
\vec{k} \tilda \vec{E} \times \vec{B}
\]

Also, all waves in a vacuum travel at the speed of light, which is given by:

\[
c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_{0} \varepsilon_{0}}}=2.99792458 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}
\]
*** Monochromatic Plane Waves
We first need to understand a wave in 1D:

\[
y(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t)
\]

Where $A$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The units of the wave number are radians per meter ($rad/m$). The units of the angular frequency are radians per second ($rad/s$).

Now, we can extend this to 3D:

\[
E(\vec{r},t) = \vec{E}_\text{max} \cos(k\ctod\vec{r} - \omega t)
\]

Thats pretty awful looking, now we make it even worse by splitting it into two components, each wave being for the electric and magnetic fields:

\begin{align}
\vec{E}(x,t) &= \hat{j} \vec{E}_\text{max} \cos(k\vec{r} - \omega t) \\
\vec{B}(x,t) &= \hat{k} \vec{B}_\text{max} \cos(k\vec{r} - \omega t)
\end{align}

Where $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$ are unit vectors in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively. The units of the magnetic field are tesla ($T$).

** Vector Sum
A vector sum is just the addition of two vectors. For example, if you have two vectors, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, then the vector sum of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x + b_x \\ a_y + b_y \end{bmatrix}
\]
** Line Integral
A definite integral gives use the area under the curve. This is done by taking very small slices of the curve and adding them together. A line integral is the same thing, but instead of taking slices of the curve, we take slices of the line and then multiply the slides by the vector filed.
