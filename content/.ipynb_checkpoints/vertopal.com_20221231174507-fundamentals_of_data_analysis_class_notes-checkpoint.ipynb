    "## Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to imagine a DataFrame as spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'],\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most useful methods for working with DataFrames:\n",
    "\n",
    "`.head()`  \n",
    "returns the first 5 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "`.tail()`  \n",
    "returns the last 5 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "`.transpose()`  \n",
    "returns the transpose of the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "`.plot.scatter(/cols/)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "`.shape`  \n",
    "returns the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "`.dtypes`  \n",
    "returns the data types of each column in the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filtering DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'],\n",
    "                  'age': [34, 25, 67],\n",
    "                  'height': [1.78, 1.65, 1.89]})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filter the DataFrame to only include people over 30\n",
    "df[df['age'] > 30]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for filtering a DataFrame is: `df[condition]`. The\n",
    "`condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either `True` or\n",
    "`False` for each row in the DataFrame. The result of the filter is a new\n",
    "DataFrame containing only the rows where the condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the `.loc` method to filter a DataFrame. The `.loc`\n",
    "method takes a list of row labels and a list of column labels as\n",
    "arguments. The result is a new DataFrame containing only the rows and\n",
    "columns specified. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'],\n",
    "                  'age': [34, 25, 67],\n",
    "                  'height': [1.78, 1.65, 1.89]})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filter the DataFrame to only include people over 30\n",
    "df.loc[df['age'] > 30, ['name', 'age']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the `.loc` method and the `[]` operator is\n",
    "that the `.loc` method can be used to filter rows and columns at the\n",
    "same time. We might want to do that if we want to filter a DataFrame by\n",
    "rows and then select a subset of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `np.where()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `np.where()` function is a vectorized version of the `if` statement.\n",
    "It takes a condition, a value to return if the condition is `True`, and\n",
    "a value to return if the condition is `False`. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a NumPy array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use np.where() to replace all values less than 3 with 0\n",
    "res = np.where(arr < 3, 0, arr)\n",
    "print(res)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` example\n",
    "[0 0 3 4 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `.sort_values()` method to sort a DataFrame by one or\n",
    "more columns. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'],\n",
    "                  'age': [34, 25, 67],\n",
    "                  'height': [1.78, 1.65, 1.89]})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort the DataFrame by age\n",
    "print(df.sort_values('age'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` example\n",
    "   name  age  height\n",
    "1  Jane   25    1.65\n",
    "0  John   34    1.78\n",
    "2   Joe   67    1.89\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid redundant filtering and aggregation, we can use the\n",
    "`.groupby()` method to group a DataFrame by one or more columns. Here is\n",
    "an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'],\n",

    "                  'height': [1.78, 1.65, 1.89]})\n",

    "# Group the DataFrame by gender\n",
    "print(df.groupby('gender').describe())\n",

    "print(df.groupby('gender').mean())\n",
    "# calculate the mean age for each gender\n",

    "-   Sampling method\n",
    "\n",

    "## Large Sample Confidence Interval for Population Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "Up till now we talked about being confident that the mean of a\n",
    "population lies within a certain interval. But, what if we want to be\n",
    "confident that the proportion of a population lies within a certain\n",
    "interval? For example, we want to be 95% confident that the proportion\n",
    "of people who like chocolate is between 0.4 and 0.6. We can use the\n",
    "following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(-z_{\\alpha/2} \\leq \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \\leq z_{\\alpha/2}) \\approx 1 - \\alpha\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion, $p$ is the population\n",
    "proportion, and $n$ is the sample size. Since we are talking about\n",
    "proportion, we are also talking about probability, and can use the\n",
    "binomial distribution, where $n$ is the number of trials, and $p$ is the\n",
    "probability of success. Remember that:\n",
    "\n",
    "An important rule to remember is that the sample proportion is\n",
    "approximately normally distributed if $np \\geq 10$ and $n(1-p) \\geq 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for a confidence interval for a population\n",
    "proportion is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "All previous confidence intervals talked about two bounds, one on the\n",
    "left and one on the right. But, what if we want to be confident that the\n",
    "population mean is greater than a certain value? For example, we want to\n",
    "be 95% confident that the population mean is within a certain range\n",
    "above the sample mean. We can use the following formula:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals for Normal Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assume that the population follows a normal distribution, that in\n",
    "only if $n$ is large enough, (viz the central limit theorem). If we have\n",
    "a sample of size $n$, then the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is approximately\n",
    "normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation\n",
    "$\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. We can use the following formula to calculate\n",

    "## Confidence Interval for the t-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a sample for which the mean is $\\bar{X}$ and the standard\n",
    "deviation is $s$, then we can define a random variable $T$ as:\n",

    "T = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of $T$ is called the **Student's t-distribution**. The\n",
    "t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, but it has fatter\n",
    "tails. The t-distribution is used when the population standard deviation\n",
    "is unknown, and the sample size is small. The t-distribution is also\n",
    "used when the population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are degrees of freedom? The degrees of freedom is the number of\n",
    "independent pieces of information in a sample. For example, if we have a\n",
    "sample of size $n$, then the degrees of freedom is $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key properties of the t-distribution:\n",

    "    normal distribution.\n",

    "Confidence interval for the mean using the t-distribution will then be\n",
    "given by this expression:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we finally get to discuss future values of some variable rather than\n",
    "estimating what might be the mean of a population.\n",

    "1.  We have a random sample of size $n$. ($X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$)\n",
    "2.  Now we want to know $X_{n+1}$.\n",

    "If we have a normal distribution, we might also be interested in finding\n",
