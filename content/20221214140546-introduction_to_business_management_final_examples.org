** Answers

1. Equilibrium is a state in which supply and demand are equal, resulting in stable prices and market conditions. Business decisions can be affected by the concept of equilibrium in that if there is an imbalance between supply and demand, prices will fluctuate accordingly. If demand increases, prices will rise; if supply increases, prices will fall. Therefore, businesses must consider these fluctuations as they make decisions about production levels, pricing, and marketing strategies.

2. Classical economics is based on the idea of laissez-faire economics, meaning that government intervention should be minimal and the free market should be allowed to operate freely with little interference from the government or other entities. Keynesian economics takes a different approach by advocating for more active government involvement in the economy via fiscal policy such as taxation and spending in order to promote economic growth. This can have implications for businesses in terms of the cost of doing business, regulation, and tax incentives.

3. A SWOT analysis is a tool used to measure a company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in order to help it develop an effective competitive strategy. Strengths and weaknesses refer to internal factors such as resources, capabilities, and the skills of the management team while opportunities and threats refer to external factors such as competitors and changes in the marketplace. By analyzing these factors, companies can identify their greatest advantages and areas of improvement in order to better position themselves against competitors.

4. The Product Life Cycle is a model that explains how products move through different stages of development from introduction to maturity to decline. Companies can use this model to make decisions about when to launch or discontinue products based on customer demand and market conditions. For example, if a company sees that demand for a particular product is declining they may decide to discontinue it or introduce new features in order to revitalize the product.

5. Porter's Five Forces are five key factors that influence industry competition: the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitutes, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, and rivalry among existing firms. These forces interact with each other to determine how competitive an industry will be; for example, high barriers to entry decrease the threat of new entrants which increases competition among existing firms resulting in lower prices for buyers. Companies must consider these forces when developing competitive strategies so that they can stay ahead of their competitors by understanding their strengths and weaknesses relative to them.

6. Organizational structures are used by companies in order to define roles within their organization as well as how tasks should be completed. There are three main types of structures: functional - where employees specialize in specific areas; divisional - where employees are divided into departments; and matrix - where employees report directly to two or more managers at once. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the company’s goals; for example, a matrix structure may be more suitable for complex projects while a functional structure may be better suited for large organizations with many departments.

7. Corporate governance involves stakeholders such as shareholders, board members, executives (the “C-Suite”), government agencies, customers/clients/partners etc., all playing a role in decision making within an organization or company. Shareholders have ownership rights over the company’s assets whereas board members provide oversight and guidance for management teams with regard to legal obligations etc.. The C-Suite is responsible for setting up strategies and ensuring they are properly implemented while government agencies regulate activities by companies in order ensure fairness under law etc.. All these stakeholders play an important role when it comes to corporate governance since they all have different interests which must be balanced out when making decisions about how best manage a business entity.

8. Internalization strategies refer to ways that companies can expand internationally by researching foreign markets prior launching operations there (market research), sending representatives abroad (commercial missions), forming partnerships with local companies (partnerships) etc.. These strategies are important because they allow companies access valuable information about foreign markets which helps them make better informed decisions when entering new markets thus reducing risk involved with international expansion .

9. The difference between asset heavy scaling methods (such as mergers & acquisitions) versus asset light scaling methods (such as franchising) is that asset heavy methods involve taking on more costs associated with acquiring assets such as factories or warehouses while asset light methods involve less risk since no physical assets need be purchased but rather agreements made between two parties allowing one party access/rights over another party's resources/assets without owning them outright . In most cases asset light methods prove more effective when attempting scalability due lower financial risks associated with them than those associated with asset heavy methods though this ultimately depends on individual circumstances faced by each business venture .

10. Cultural management is important because it allows organizations understand how culture impacts workplace dynamics which then affects employee performance , morale , creativity , productivity , communication etc... Cultural dimension models like Hofstede’s or Trompenaars’s provide insight into various aspects of culture such as power distance , uncertainty avoidance , collectivism vs individualism etc.. Such models can help businesses identify cultural differences between countries/regions which can then inform HR policies tailored towards each region thereby helping them improve cross-cultural relations & communication within multinational workforces .
