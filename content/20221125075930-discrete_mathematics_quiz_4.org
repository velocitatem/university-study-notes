* Path Finding
A path finding algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between two points, while avoiding obstacles. It relies on a concept called *discretization*, which simplifies the problem by limiting the regions of the map into a finite set.
To understand how we can move around the map we create relations which describe from where and to where we can move.
* Relations
The relation ranging from some set $A$ to the set $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product between the two sets. To denote the relation between two set we use the notation $a R b$, which can also be expressed with $(a,b) \in R$.

To represent a binary relation in a more legible format other than a list of lists, we can use a matrix.

| *R* | *1* | *2* | *3* |
| *a* | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| *b* | 1 | 1 | 0 |


** Binary Relations
The number of binary relations, for some set $A$ with $n$ elements, is given by:

\[
2^{n^2}
\]

** Reflexive Relations
For some relation $R$ on $A$, it has the property of being reflexive if and only if:

\[
\forall a \in A ((a,a) \in R)
\]

An easy way to recognize this in a relation, is using a matrix and seeing that all the values alone the *diagonal* are 1s.

If we want to show that a relation is not reflexive, since it has $\forall$, we just need to show one case for which it is not true. This is done by finding a pair $\exists a \in A [(a,a) | a\ \not{R}\ a]$.
If this holds true, then we say the relation is *irreflexive*. This type of relation is defined by:

\[
\forall a \in A ((a,a) \not \in R)
\]

If all the mentioned properties of a relation are satisfied, we call it a *poset*.

** Symmetric Relations
A relation is told to be symmetric if it has two pairs which are the inverse of each other. The definition is as follows:

\[
\forall a \in A \forall b \in A (((a,b) \in R) \Leftrightarrow ((b,a) \in R))
\]

To recognize this in a matrix, we need to see if the values are mirrored over the diagonal.

** Antisymmetric Relations

:END:
For a relation to be antisymmetric, it must be that the non-diagonal values for an inverse relationship have a different value. Mathematically it is defined as follows:

\[
\forall a \in A \forall b in A (((a, b) \in R) \in \neg ((b,a) in R))
\]

For it to be true, there can be no one pair of relations which are symetric.

** Transitive Relations
This type of relation is the hardest to detect when looking at a matrix. It is conceptually similar to the hypothetical syllogism. In english, it could be describe as the property of a relation, in which a connection defined by $n$ relations, can be simplified to just one relation.

\[
\forall a \forall b \forall c (((a,b) \in R) \land ((b,c) \in R) \to ((a,c) \in R))
\]

* Relation Composition
The composition of relations, is a relations, which begins in the first term of the first set and ends in the last term of the last set.

\[
\forall a \forall b (((a,b) \in F \circ B) \Leftrightarrow \exists c(((a,c) \in G) \land ((c,b) \in F)))
\]

The composite relation of the same set over different variations $n$ is represented as $R^n$.

* Other Relation Operations
+ Converse(Inverse/Transposition) :: This relation, given by $R^T$ is defined by $\{(y,x); xRy\}$ where the elements of the ordered pair are flipped.
+ Negation :: This operation should give the complement of the original relation set. Represented by $\bar{R}$.
+ Union :: This relation is analogous to binary addition, and can easily be done if we are looking at the relational matrices.
+ Intersection :: Similarly to the union, it is easiest to do if we are looking at the matrices, except, this time we multiply the respective values.


* Closures
A closure, is a collection of changes which need to be made (only additions) so that a relation satisfies certain property. It must be done with the minimum possible number of pairs.

** Reflexive Closure
With this closure, it is our aim to change the relation so that it is reflexive. This is done by adding all the missing connections between $(a,a)$, or simply changing all the values on the diagonal of the relational matrix to 1.
If we have to do to do this on a graph, we just add loops to each node.

** Irreflexive Closure
This can only be done if there are no $(a,a)$ pair in the relation, because otherwise we would have to remove some and we cannot do that when defining a closure.
** Symmetric closure
This closure can be done by adding each missing $(b,a)$ pair for all $(a,b)$ pair. In a matrix, we simply write a 1 for each mirrored value over the diagonal.
The easiest way to do this, is to transpose the matrix and add it to the original.
** Transitive Closure
The transitive closure of a matrix is done by adding any missing links for paths which can be done in more than 1 steps.


** Partial Ordering
A partially ordered set is a set with a relation which is:
+ Reflexive
+ Antisymmetric
+ Transitive
Think kind of set is also referred to as a *poset*, which is denoted by $(A,R)$, where $R$ is the relation with all the above mentioned traits.

To create a Hasse Diagram from any relation represented by a graph, we have to follow the following rules:

1. Make sure all arrows point up
2. Remove all loops
3. Remove all transitive vectors(connections)
